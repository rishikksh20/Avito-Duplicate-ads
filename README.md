# Avito-Duplicate-ads
 Avito hosts high volumes of listings and competitive sellers often go to great lengths to get their wares noticed.For some sellers, this means posting the same ad several times with slightly altered text or photos taken from different angles. To ensure that buyers can easily find what they're looking for without sifting through dozens of deceptively identical ads, Avito is asking Kagglers to develop a model that can automatically spot duplicate ads. With more accurate duplicate ad detection, Avito will make it much easier for buyers to find and make their next purchase with an honest seller.
